FrontEnd Development Project using JQuery UI and ajax
This a project I made for one of my college subjects addressing web development. It uses a MySQL server along with an Apache one working at localhost to save the information of the projects and the tasks of every project. The queries are manage through PHP documents running on the Apache server to make the client contact with the database. The client-side of the application was developed using a main HTML file, several CSS stylesheets and the JQuery and JQuery UI library.
